## Introduction:
  Not everyone has the right state of mind and body in this pandemic but almost everyone has a webcam.

In a digital world affected by COVID-19, digital diagnosis and fitness both mental and physical is more necessary than ever. The pandemic has caused an influx in hospital cases, and the limitations on hospital beds have people wondering whether their symptoms are severe enough to warrant a doctor's appointment. Meanwhile, others experience ailments but are unable to afford a visit to the doctor due to a lack of or poor health care. We are in alarming need of free and practical digital healthcare for keeping in touch with our medical needs. More than 2 in 5 people globally reported symptoms of depression and anxiety during the pandemic. As students, we have realized that a lot of our time is spent in front of a laptop and first-hand watched our mental health deteriorate during the pandemic. Even Thatâ€™s why having an application like Healthzone is so important!
  
## Table of Contents:
  Healthzone is an app that allows users to regularly check up on their physical and mental well-being without needing to visit a doctor unless needed and enjoy AR/VR fitness demos.

We analyze your health using just two inputs - your video and your text. The features of our product are numbered below:

First, it can register the "mood" of a person. This is very important to provide automated action and suggestions from the website and to the user. The product can detect a total of 4 moods: happy, sad, angry, and neutral through the webcam of the user. With different moods, the website can perform different actions. If the user is happy, the website suggests if it should play the user's favorite Spotify playlist. If the user is sad, the website suggests if it should tell the user a joke and play upbeat music. It can also ask "check-up" questions. The website also plots a graph of your emotions in a fixed time necessary for regular mental checkup and even suggests to take counsellor help by booking a call.

There is a friendly chatbot to answer your questions and can even alert the user's relative/friend through SMS if the user gets suicidal and depressed to a certain level. This can be of great help to save someone's precious life.

We have a symptom checker section where you can just give your inputs step-by-step according to your issues and complaints to get a probable disease diagnosis and department of medicine to be contacted in the case of severity.

Finally, we have a flowing UI catering to the needs of the users. We have tried to make the overall look and feel to make it calming, soothing, safe and engaging enough for our users.

We also have a AR/VR fitness workout sections.
